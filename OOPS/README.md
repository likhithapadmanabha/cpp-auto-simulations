This code demonstrates dynamic polymorphism in C++ using a vehicle alert system.
Different alerts (Seatbelt, Door, Handbrake) are implemented as derived classes of a common Notification interface.

At runtime, the system decides which alert to show based on simulated sensor event
Real-world analogy â†’ Car dashboard shows alerts based on active sensor
